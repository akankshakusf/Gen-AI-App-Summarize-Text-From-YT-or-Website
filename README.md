## 🔥 **Why Businesses Need Custom Generative AI Models**  

Generative AI is **revolutionizing industries**, but its **true power lies in customization**. Large Language Models (LLMs) like **Gemma2-9b-it** provide **generalized outputs**, but businesses can **supercharge these models** by integrating **their own knowledge base, logic, and proprietary data**.

Companies can build **internal AI assistants** that:
1. **Learn from their own business data.**  
2. **Apply company-specific rules and logic.**  
3. **Deliver personalized insights relevant to their domain.**  
4. **Enhance employee productivity by summarizing, extracting, and analyzing data at scale.**
